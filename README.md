# Implementation-of-ML-model-for-image-classification
Implementing a machine learning (ML) model for image classification involves several key steps, which can be broken down into data preparation, model development, training, and evaluation. The goal of image classification is to enable a model to assign a label or category to an image based on its content

## Key Steps in the Image Classification Process:
    1. Data Preprocessing: This step includes loading the image dataset, normalizing pixel values, and augmenting the data (optional) to increase training diversity. Image data often requires resizing and standardization to make it suitable for ML models.

    2. Model Development: The model architecture is selected based on the problem at hand. For image classification, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are commonly used due to their ability to extract features from images. These models can be built using deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or even traditional machine learning algorithms like Support Vector Machines (SVMs) or Random Forests for simpler tasks.

    3. Model Training: During this phase, the model is trained on labeled data by optimizing its parameters (weights) to minimize the loss function. This step often involves adjusting hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs.

    4. Model Evaluation: After training, the model is evaluated on a separate test dataset to assess its performance.     Metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are commonly used to gauge how well the model generalizes to new, unseen data.

 ## Key Feature

  - **MobileNetV2 (ImageNet)**:MobileNetV2 is a lightweight deep learning architecture designed for mobile and embedded devices. It uses depthwise separable convolutions, which significantly reduce the number of parameters and computations compared to traditional convolutional networks. This makes it suitable for mobile image classification tasks while maintaining a high accuracy rate.

  - **Custom CIFAR-10 Model**:To implement a custom model for CIFAR-10 image classification using TensorFlow/Keras, we'll create a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) from scratch or use a pre-trained model like MobileNetV2 to fine-tune. CIFAR-10 is a popular dataset consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images across 10 classes (e.g., airplane, car, bird, etc.).
